    <p>With the expanded demands for JavaScript, an easier means for programmers to develop such dynamic interfaces was needed.[3][4] Thus, JavaScript libraries and JavaScript widget libraries were developed, allowing for developers to concentrate more upon more distinctive applications of Ajax.[5] This has led to other companies and groups, such as Microsoft and Yahoo! developing their own JavaScript-based user interface libraries, which find their way into the web applications developed by these companies.[6] Some JavaScript libraries allow for easier integration of JavaScript with other web development technologies, such as CSS, PHP, Ruby, and Java, while others provide utilities, often in the form of JavaScript functions, to make repetitive and complex tasks less taxing.[7][8] Many libraries include code to detect differences between runtime environments and remove the need for applications to allow for such inconsistencies.[citation needed]</p>
